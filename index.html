<h2><a name="conf">Teaching and work in the academia</a></h2>	
    <ul>
	    <li>During Spring 2020, he teaches the Python prog lang at the University of Florence (slides: <a href="https://massimo-nocentini.github.io/UniFI-Python-Spring-2020/introduction.slides.html#/">Introduction</a>, <a href="https://massimo-nocentini.github.io/UniFI-Python-Spring-2020/jupyter-notebooks.slides.html#/">Jupyter notebooks</a>, <a href="https://massimo-nocentini.github.io/UniFI-Python-Spring-2020/numpy.slides.html#/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://massimo-nocentini.github.io/UniFI-Python-Spring-2020/pandas.slides.html#/">Pandas</a>). <br>A note about copyright: all the content has been taken from <a href="https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook">Jake Vanderplas</a>, therefore I have no merits for it; I just put notebooks into slides for my own educational needs.</li>
	<li>From April 2019 to March 2020 he received a contract to collaborate with <a href="https://www.disia.unifi.it/p-doc2-2016-200052-V-3f2b342b352728-0.html">prof.
	Daniele Vignoli</a> in a scholarship titled <em>Rilevamento dell'incertezza economica attraverso stampa e social media</em>. This research requires that machine learning techniques should be employed to perform Natural Language Processing on a selection of articles appeared
	on Italian newspapers; he trained word embeddings based upon the Wikipedia snapshot
	at 1st of July 2019 and have started the training of a model for the NLP
	Python package <a href="https://spacy.io/">Spacy</a> concerning the Italian language.</li>
	<li>He did two classes about <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a> to introduce symbolic manipulations on top of the Python language, within a course on <em>Analysis of
        Algorithms</em> taught by Donatella Merlini at the University of Florence; in
    addition, he translated lab sessions code from Maple to Python collected in
    notebooks available online (<a href="https://github.com/massimo-nocentini/pacc/tree/master/paa-course">link</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="conf">Work outside academia</a></h2>
    
    During his studies he worked in middle-sized software houses, formerly at   	
	<a href="https://www.commitsoftware.it/">Commit</a> and lately at
    <a href="http://www.negens.com/site/home.html">Negens</a>, developing mainly client-server
    applications using industrial-strength languages such as Java and C#, for
    about eight years, part-time relationships in parallel with his studies; in short,
    <ul>
        <li>a software to generate bet systems for the Italian circuit
        <em>Sisal</em>, written in C#; precisely, the software allows a group
        of lotteries to authenticate using a secure channels and personal
        tokens with a server that regularly fetched odds from the Sisal
        provider. Then, it generates reports with tables containing a
        subset of events that satisfies the lotteries' constraints.</li>
        <li>a software that takes into account VAT registers and economic
        transactions for small bussnesses. Again, written in C# interfacing 
        with MSSQL servers, using advanced SQL features about pivot tables,
        cursors, views and stored procedures; this software were developed in
        a joint effort with a group in Milan, Italy.</li>
        <li>little projects about sensors, microcontrollers and home
        automation using Linux boxes and the RaspberryPi, interfacing with C
        code while scripting in Python; heavy use of shell and network protocols
        for messages exchange.</li>
        <li>he collaborated with prof. Enrico Vicario under a scholarship titled
        <em>Architetture e metodi per la cooperazione applicativa</em>; the collaboration
        took two years where he worked on a simulator for gas and water networks.</li>
    </ul>
	After my PhD dissertation I have opened a VAT and currently I collaborate with 
	<a href="http://neu.bauing-schmidt.de/">Schmidt</a> company on Smalltalk technologies.
