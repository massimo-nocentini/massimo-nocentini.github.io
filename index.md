## Teaching and work in the academia
- During Spring 2020, he (co)teaches the course <a href="https://www.unifi.it/p-ins2-2019-544175-1.html">Algorithms and Programming for Massive Data</a> at the University of Florence (slides: <a href="https://massimo-nocentini.github.io/UniFI-Python-Spring-2020/introduction.slides.html#/">Introduction</a>, <a href="https://massimo-nocentini.github.io/UniFI-Python-Spring-2020/jupyter-notebooks.slides.html#/">Jupyter notebooks</a>, <a href="https://massimo-nocentini.github.io/UniFI-Python-Spring-2020/numpy.slides.html#/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://massimo-nocentini.github.io/UniFI-Python-Spring-2020/pandas.slides.html#/">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://massimo-nocentini.github.io/UniFI-Python-Spring-2020/matplotlib.slides.html#/">Matplotlib</a>, <a href="https://massimo-nocentini.github.io/UniFI-Python-Spring-2020/networkx.slides.html#/">NetworkX</a>, <a href="https://massimo-nocentini.github.io/UniFI-Python-Spring-2020/gotchas.slides.html#/">gotchas</a> and <a href="https://massimo-nocentini.github.io/UniFI-Python-Spring-2020/generators.slides.html#/">generators</a>, respectively). <br>A note about copyright: all the content has been taken from <a href="https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook">Jake Vanderplas</a>, therefore I have no merits for it; I just put notebooks into slides for my own educational needs.
- From April 2019 to March 2020 he received a contract to collaborate with <a href="https://www.disia.unifi.it/p-doc2-2016-200052-V-3f2b342b352728-0.html">prof. Daniele Vignoli</a> in a scholarship titled *Rilevamento dell'incertezza economica attraverso stampa e social media*. This research requires that machine learning techniques should be employed to perform Natural Language Processing on a selection of articles appeared on Italian newspapers; he trained word embeddings based upon the Wikipedia snapshot at 1st of July 2019 and have started the training of a model for the NLP Python package <a href="https://spacy.io/">Spacy</a> concerning the Italian language.
- He did two classes about <a href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a> to introduce symbolic manipulations on top of the Python language, within a course on *Analysis of Algorithms* taught by Donatella Merlini at the University of Florence; in addition, he translated lab sessions code from Maple to Python collected in notebooks available online (<a href="https://github.com/massimo-nocentini/pacc/tree/master/paa-course">link</a>).
- He collaborated with [prof. Enrico Vicario](https://stlab.dinfo.unifi.it/vicario/) under a scholarship titled *Architetture e metodi per la cooperazione applicativa*; the collaboration took two years where he worked on a simulator for gas and water networks.

## Work outside academia
    
After his PhD dissertation he have opened a VAT and currently he collaborate with <a href="http://neu.bauing-schmidt.de/">Schmidt</a> company using Smalltalk technologies.

During his studies he worked in software houses localized in Florence, Italy; formerly at   	
<a href="https://www.commitsoftware.it/">Commit</a> and lately at
<a href="http://www.negens.com/site/home.html">Negens</a>, developing mainly client-server
applications using industrial-strength languages such as Java and C#, for
about eight years, part-time relationships in parallel with his studies; in short,

- a software to generate bet systems for the Italian circuit
  *Sisal*, written in C#; precisely, the software allows a group
  of lotteries to authenticate using a secure channels and personal
  tokens with a server that regularly fetched odds from the Sisal
  provider. Then, it generates reports with tables containing a
  subset of events that satisfies the lotteries' constraints.
- a software that takes into account VAT registers and economic
  transactions for small bussnesses. Again, written in C# interfacing 
  with MSSQL servers, using advanced SQL features about pivot tables,
  cursors, views and stored procedures; this software were developed in
  a joint effort with a group in Milan, Italy.
- little projects about sensors, microcontrollers and home
  automation using Linux boxes and the RaspberryPi, interfacing with C
  code while scripting in Python; heavy use of shell and network protocols
  for messages exchange.
